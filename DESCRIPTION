Description: A collection of functions to make R a more effective viewscape analysis 
    tool for calculating viewscape metrics based on computing the viewable area for 
    given a point/multiple viewpoints and a digital elevation model.The method of calculating 
    viewscape metrics implemented in this package are based on the work of 
    Tabrizian et al. (2020) <doi:10.1016/j.landurbplan.2019.103704>. The algorithm of computing 
    viewshed is based on the work of 
    Franklin & Ray. (1994) <https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=555780f6f5d7e537eb1edb28862c86d1519af2be>.
